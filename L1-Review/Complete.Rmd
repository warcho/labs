```{r L1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#The dataset we are exploring has influenza and pneumonia deaths on a state and national level, over time. 

#We will be requiring knitr, dplyr, and ggplot2
setwd('~/TA stuff/Winter2017/labs/L1-Review/')
require(dplyr)
require(knitr)
require(ggplot2)

#Read in the dataset
deaths <- read.csv('flu_deaths.csv')

#Handle NA values
deaths[is.na(deaths)] <- 0

```

This table shows the number of flu and pneumonia deaths by state for 2016-17, with California having the most deaths and Connecticut having the lowest amount with **0** deaths.

```{r summary, echo=FALSE}

#Summary table
deaths_summary <- filter(deaths, geoid == "State", season == "2016-17") %>%
                  select(State, season, Deaths.from.pneumonia.and.influenza) %>%
                  group_by(State, season) %>%
                  summarize(num_deaths = sum(Deaths.from.pneumonia.and.influenza)) %>%
                  select(State, num_deaths) %>%
                  arrange(desc(num_deaths))

kable(deaths_summary) #makes table pretty

```

This plot shows the percent of total deaths in the USA caused by the flu and pnemonia between 2009 and 2017. As can be expected, the 2017 values are quite *low* considering how it is currently early January of 2017.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}

#Plot
deaths_plot <- filter(deaths, geoid == "National", age == "65 years and older") %>%
               select(geoid, age, season, Deaths.from.pneumonia.and.influenza, All.Deaths) %>%
               group_by(season) %>%
               summarize(flu_deaths = sum(Deaths.from.pneumonia.and.influenza), 
                         total_deaths = sum(All.Deaths), 
                         percent_flu = (flu_deaths / total_deaths * 100))

p <- ggplot(deaths_plot, aes(season, percent_flu))
p + geom_point() # need this in RMD

```
